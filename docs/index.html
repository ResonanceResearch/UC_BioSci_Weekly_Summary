      <h2>Automated weekly summary</h2>
      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">The following five works were published between 2025-09-22 and 2025-09-29. For each, I name the venue and the cohort author(s) exactly as provided, and summarize with up to three concise findings.

1) The sample size of the typical ecological correlation coefficient is small and slowly declining — Oikos (2025-09-26) — Cohort author: Jeremy W. Fox
- Analyzes over 16,000 correlation coefficients from 232 ecological meta-analyses; median sample size is about 30 observations.
- Finds most ecological correlations have low statistical power against zero correlation, with sample sizes declining since WWII.
- Suggests that shifting research practices may explain why more correlations are reported today despite smaller samples.

2) A roadmap for equitable reuse of public microbiome data — Nature Microbiology (2025-09-26) — Cohort author: Ann Gregory
- Proposes a framework for equitable, responsible reuse and access to public microbiome datasets.
- Highlights standards for data sharing, metadata, privacy, and reproducibility.
- Discusses governance and community practices to enable inclusive reuse of microbiome data.

3) AtuR and MarR transcriptional repressors that sense fatty or naphthenic acids and regulate degradation or antimicrobial resistance operons in Pseudomonas sp. OST1909 — bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) (2025-09-24) — Cohort author: Lisa M. Gieg
- Demonstrates AtuR and MarR repressors regulate atu and mar operons in response to fatty and naphthenic acids in Pseudomonas sp. OST1909.
- Constructs plasmid-encoded lux reporters and shows repressor-controlled promoters; EMSA confirms binding to palindromic promoter sites.
- Shows that fatty/naphthenic acids prevent repressor–DNA binding and that the marR-H biosensor is functional in E. coli, implying direct NA sensing by these regulators.

4) Prolactin and DNA damage trigger an anti-breast cancer cell immune response — Frontiers in Endocrinology (2025-09-23) — Cohort authors: Constance A. M. Finney; Carrie S. Shemanko
- In vivo, doxorubicin plus prolactin increases tumor latency in orthotopic xenografts; prolactin alone does not alter latency.
- Depletion of asialo GM1-positive immune cells accelerates tumor formation only in PRL+ doxorubicin-pretreated cells.
- In vitro, PRL plus doxorubicin attracts cytotoxic NK cells in a PRLR-dependent manner.

5) Accuracy of machine learning techniques for real-time prediction of implanted lower limb mechanics with comprehensive and reduced input parameters — Computer Methods in Biomechanics & Biomedical Engineering (2025-09-23) — Cohort author: Clare K. Fitzpatrick
- Compares linear regression, biLSTM, and transformer models for real-time knee/implant mechanics prediction using a 1500-simulation training dataset.
- BiLSTM yields roughly 45% lower nRMSE with reduced inputs than the other models.
- Points toward clinical utility in optimizing implant positioning pre- or intra-operatively.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Larger sample sizes are desirable because they minimize sampling error. However, they are not the only desideratum, and it is unknown if sample sizes in ecology trade off with other desiderata. Here I describe the typical sample size of ecological studies reporting correlation coefficients, describe how sample sizes have changed over time, and develop a hypothesis to explain these changes. Using a database of over 16 000 correlation coefficients reported in 232 meta‐analyses covering a wide range of ecological topics, I find that the median sample size of these 16 000+ correlation coefficients is just 30 observations. This implies that the majority of ecological correlation coefficients likely have low statistical power against the null hypothesis of zero correlation. The typical sample size of an ecological correlation coefficient has decreased slowly since WW II. Decreasing sample sizes may reflect changing research practices. Recent ecology papers tend to report more correlation coefficients, with smaller sample sizes, than they did decades ago. Ecologists today may be choosing to measure more correlations among more variables than ecologists decades ago, even at the cost of smaller sample sizes per correlation. Further research is needed to identify other factors that might drive declining sample sizes of ecological correlation coefficients, and to determine if ecological sample sizes are declining more broadly. It is unclear if declining sample sizes represent a systemic problem for ecological research, given that large sample size is only one of many desiderata in scientific research, and that large sample sizes may trade off with other desiderata. But the trend towards smaller sample sizes should be recognized so that its implications can be discussed.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Naphthenic acids (NA) are a complex family of acyclic and cyclic carboxylic acids that accumulate in tailings after bitumen extraction from oil sands in Alberta. In response to exposure to naphthenic acids, Pseudomonas sp. OST1909 induces the expression of operons regulated by TetR and MarR-type transcriptional repressors. This class of repressor releases from promoters after binding small molecules, leading to a de-repression of the target operons. We propose that these regulators sense fatty and naphthenic acids and control the expression of genes required to cope with their exposure. Plasmid-encoded transcriptional lux reporters to the atu degradation and mar antimicrobial resistance promoters were constructed that also included the corresponding repressor protein, controlled by various strength constitutive promoters. We provide evidence that the atuAR and marR promoters are directly repressed by AtuR and MarR, respectively. His-tagged MarR and AtuR proteins bound to their promoters containing palindromic binding sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Fatty and naphthenic acid compounds and mixtures prevented promoter DNA binding to the repressor proteins in EMSA assays, which suggested direct analyte binding to the protein. The marR-H biosensor construct was functional when introduced into E. coli, confirming the role of NA sensing and transcriptional repressor proteins. This study provides mechanistic insight into the use of NA-inducible promoters as bacterial biosensors for NA detection and identifies novel ligands for the MarR and TetR types of repressor proteins.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Introduction The role of prolactin (PRL) in breast cancer and its role within the context of the tumor microenvironment are not well understood. In our previous study, we demonstrated a cross-talk between the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) DNA damage response pathway and the PRL-Janus-kinase-2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5)-heat shock protein-90 (HSP90) pathway. Here we investigated the role of PRL in tumor initiation and the effect of DNA damage. Methods We used an in vivo model to assess the ability of breast cancer cells to initiate orthotopic xenograft tumor formation after DNA damage. Breast cancer cells engineered to secrete human PRL were treated with the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin and injected into the mammary fat pad of immune-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice. Results Doxorubicin and PRL combination increased the tumor latency, although PRL secretion alone did not change the tumor latency compared to the controls. Depletion of glycolipid asialo ganglioside-GM1-positive immune cells using anti-asialo GM1 antibody resulted in faster tumor formation only in the PRL-secreting breast cancer cells that were pre-treated with doxorubicin. Additionally, doxorubicin plus the PRL treatment of breast cancer cells was shown in vitro to attract cytotoxic NK cells compared to the controls, and this was dependent on the PRLR. Discussion These results demonstrate that combined breast cancer cell DNA damage and PRL exposure results in the anti-tumor cell activity of asialo-GM1-positive immune cells.</div></details></td>
