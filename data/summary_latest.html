      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">Red squirrel gestation length is unchanged by maternal traits, litter composition, or future food availability — Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2025-09-05. Cohort authors: Robert M. R. Barclay.
Gestation length is highly conserved with minimal variation (35.4 ± 1.49 days) across 27 years of data. Maternal age, litter size, and litter sex ratio do not affect gestation length. Anticipated food pulses from conifer mast do not significantly alter gestation length, suggesting buffering or strong heritability.

Role of AprA and pyocyanin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Staphylococcus aureus tolerance to silver — Microbiology, 2025-09-03. Cohort authors: Raymond J. Turner; Omid Haji-Ghassemi.
AprA protease and pyocyanin are identified as the factors increasing S. aureus tolerance to AgNO3. Disrupting aprA abolishes the supernatant’s enhancement of silver tolerance, linking AprA to this effect. The mechanism implies AprA modulates pyocyanin levels, which in turn detoxify silver by reducing Ag2+.

A Call for Bio-Inspired Technologies: Promises and Challenges for Ecosystem Service Replacement — Biomimetics, 2025-09-02. Cohort authors: Mindi M. Summers.
The piece argues for transdisciplinary design of bio-inspired technologies to replace ecosystem services. Soil-formation is used as a case; fewer than 1% of biomimetics studies address soil-based replacement, signaling a gap. It proposes scenario planning around ecosystem collapse and calls for collaborative, equitable sustainable innovation.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Despite considerable research on reproductive timing, factors influencing intraspecific variation in gestation length in wild mammals have received limited attention, largely due to a lack of high-resolution data. We examined potential drivers of gestation length variation in a wild population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, Erxleben, 1777) in Yukon, Canada. Drawing on 27 years of conception and parturition data, we found that gestation length was highly conserved, with minimal variation (35.4 ± 1.49 days; mean ± SD). Gestation length was unaffected by maternal age, litter size, or litter sex ratio. Likewise, the anticipation of an upcoming food pulse, caused by synchronous conifer seed masting, had no statistically significant influence on gestation length. This finding stands in contrast to other reproductive traits in red squirrels, which are known to shift in response to food pulses. Overall, our results suggest that gestation length in red squirrels is buffered against environmental variability, likely due to stabilizing selection or strong heritability.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">The opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often found together causing persistent infections where they exhibit complex interactions that affect their virulence and resistance to treatment. We sought to clarify how interactions between these organisms affect their resistance to the antimicrobial metal silver (AgNO 3 ). As previous work showed that cell-free supernatant from P. aeruginosa enhances the resistance of S. aureus, we aimed to identify the exact factor(s) responsible for this increase. Using molecular weight cutoff filters and proteomics, we identified the protein AprA and pyocyanin as the responsible factors. Transposon-mediated disruption of aprA led to the production of supernatant which could not enhance the silver tolerance of S. aureus . These findings suggest that the protease AprA from P. aeruginosa plays an important role in increasing the tolerance of S. aureus to AgNO 3 via in part by mediating the levels of pyocyanin which in turn reduces Ag 2+ to detoxify it.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Ecosystem services are crucial for animals, plants, the planet, and human well-being. Decreasing biodiversity and environmental destruction of ecosystems will have severe consequences. Designing technologies that could support, enhance, or even replace ecosystem services is a complex task that the Manufactured Ecosystems Project team considers to be only achievable with transdisciplinarity, as it unlocks new directions for designing research and development systems. One of these directions in the project is bio-inspiration, learning from natural systems as the foundation for manufacturing ecosystem services. Using soil formation as a case study, text-mining of existing scientific literature reveals a critical gap: fewer than 1% of studies in biomimetics address soil formation technological replacement, despite the rapid global decline in natural soil formation processes. The team sketches scenarios of ecosystem collapse, identifying how bio-inspired solutions for equitable and sustainable innovation can contribute to climate adaptation. The short communication opens the discussion for collaboration and aims to initiate future research.</div></details></td>
