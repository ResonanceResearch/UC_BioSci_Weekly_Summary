- The study shows Crhr1 activation drives the central Ras-MAPK pathway to modulate acute stress–induced hyperlocomotion in larval zebrafish. 
- Pharmacological Ras inhibition with BAY-293 blocks both CRH- and epinephrine-induced hyperactivity and prevents rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation in pallial/hypothalamic regions. 
- crhr1-/- larvae upregulate a1-adrenoceptor genes and abolish epinephrine-induced hyperactivity (though forskolin-induced hyperactivity remains), with stress- and epinephrine-driven c-fos induction occurring in a Ras-dependent manner but Crhr1-independent.

Microbiology Resource Announcements (2025-09-10) — coauthor: Michael F. Hynes
- Michael F. Hynes reports the genome sequences of two Rhizobium-infecting siphophages, B1VFA and V1VFA-S, isolated from Canadian agricultural soils, expanding rhizobiophage diversity. 
- Both phages encode plasmid maintenance genes parA, parB, and repC and share a similar genome architecture, indicating phage-plasmid–like features. 
- These data suggest these siphophages may constitute a distinct siphophage lineage within Rhizobium.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Introduction Although the Crh-Crhr1 system is the proximal trigger for the stressor-induced corticosteroid release, its role in initiating the fight-or-flight response to an acute stressor is unclear. We hypothesized that the Crh-Crhr1 system deploys the central Ras-Mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway and rapidly increases the locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae. Methods We tested this using an acute stressor-induced hyperactivity model in larval zebrafish that is Crhr1-dependent, and a pharmacological inhibitor of Ras (BAY-293). Results The larval hyperactivity response to stress disappeared after pretreatment with BAY-293. Acute CRH exposure stimulated the hyperactivity but at a lower magnitude than epinephrine; however, both responses were inhibited by BAY-293. Immunohistochemical localization revealed rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the pallium and hypothalamic regions after acute CRH and epinephrine treatment. The lack of Crhr1 ( crhr1-/- ) upregulated the a1-adrenoceptors ( adra1ab and adra1ba ) and abolished the epinephrine-induced, but not the forskolin-induced hyperactivity. The acute stressor also increased the transcript abundance of c-fos , commonly used as a marker of neuronal activation and plasticity. This immediate early gene response to stress was mimicked by epinephrine, but not Crh treatment, and was Ras-dependent. The acute stressor- or epinephrine-induced c-fos response was unaltered in larvae lacking a functional Crhr1. Discussion This study reveals the activation of the Ras-Mapk pathway by Crhr1 as a central mechanism modulating the acute stress-induced larval hyper-locomotor activity but not the c-fos response in zebrafish. Altogether, our results suggest a complementary but essential role for Crhr1 in facilitating the epinephrine-mediated fight-or-flight response but not the stress-habituation response.</div></details></td>
